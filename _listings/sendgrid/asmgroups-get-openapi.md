  title: SendGrid Get Asm Groups
  description: |-
    **This endpoint allows you to retrieve information about multiple suppression groups.**

    This endpoint will return information for each group ID that you include in your request. To add a group ID to your request, simply append `&id=` followed by the group ID.

    Suppressions are a list of email addresses that will not receive content sent under a given [group](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Suppression_Management/groups.html).

    Suppression groups, or [unsubscribe groups](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Suppression_Management/groups.html), allow you to label a category of content that you regularly send. This gives your recipients the ability to opt out of a specific set of your email. For example, you might define a group for your transactional email, and one for your marketing email so that your users can continue recieving your transactional email witout having to receive your marketing content.
